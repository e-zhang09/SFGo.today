## TROUBLESHOOTING

A: Please refresh your page, resizing the browser window will affect usability  

Q: The site isn't loading?  
A: Make sure WIFI is enabled. Or if you are viewing the site as local-host make sure to open index.html (by double clicking the file). However, to login into the dashboard, you will need to be connected to WIFI.

Q: Why can't I create an account?  
A: We are using the free version of Firebase so quotas might've been reached

Q: Why is the website seem squished or elongated?  
A: Try zooming in or out of your browser. Many times, you have zoomed in or out too much, which causes the website to attempt to resize.
